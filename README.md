# README #

This repository hosts "safety" code, to keep our code distrubed so in case there was a loss, we never lose the project.



This is holds the development code.. the production is in the other repo. Why not just branch? So many reasons I am so lazy to list.

For the rest of the guidelines and set up instructions, those are for the production README.md

# PS: We are so close to delivering something real good! *excitement* (loving this project)
